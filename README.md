# Template Configs
This project contains scripts and config files to easily add TailwindCSS and @swc/jest dependencies / config files to a react ts project

## Getting Started
 1. Clone this repo beside your react project (for example: ```my-project```)
 2. From the root directory of ```my-project``` run ```../template-configs/install_deps.sh``` (this will install tailwindcss and @swc/jest dependencies in your project and copy over the required config files)
